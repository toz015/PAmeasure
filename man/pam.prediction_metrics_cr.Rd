\usage{
pam.prediction_metrics_cr(
  ftime,
  fstatus,
  metrics,
  pred.cif,
  time.cif,
  event.type = 1,
  tau = NULL,
  t_star = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{ftime}{Numeric vector of observed event/censoring times.}

\item{fstatus}{Numeric vector indicating event status:
- 0: censored
- 1: primary event of interest
- Other values: competing events}

\item{metrics}{Character vector specifying metrics to compute. Available options:
\itemize{
\item "R_square": Explained variation metric
\item "L_square": Loss-based metric
\item "Pesudo_R": Pseudo R-squared
\item "Harrells_C": Harrell's concordance index
\item "Unos_C": Uno's concordance index
\item "R_sph": Spherical explained variation
\item "R_sh": Schoeffel's explained variation
\item "Brier_Score": Brier score at t_star
\item "Time_Dependent_Auc": Time-dependent AUC curve
\item "all": Compute all available metrics
}}

\item{pred.cif}{Matrix of predicted cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) for the primary event.
Rows represent subjects, columns correspond to time points in time.cif.}

\item{time.cif}{Numeric vector of time points associated with columns in pred.cif.}

\item{event.type}{Numeric value specifying which event in fstatus is the primary event
(default = 1).}

\item{tau}{truncation time for evaluation. Times beyond tau are truncated, and
competing events are treated as censored at tau (default = NULL).}

\item{t_star}{Optional time point for metrics requiring fixed-time evaluation (e.g., Brier score).}

\item{start_time}{Optional start time for evaluation window in time-dependent metrics.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing computed performance metrics with columns:
- Metric: Name of the performance metric
- Value: Computed value
}
\description{
This function computes performance metrics for survival models with competing risks,
using predicted cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) and observed event data. It handles
competing events by truncating observation times at a specified horizon (tau) and treating
non-target events as censored. Metrics are computed using processed predictions and adjusted
event statuses.
