\title{Compute the Concordance Statistic}
\usage{
pam.concordance(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model or a formula of the form y ~ x or y ~ x + strata(z) with
a single numeric or survival response and a single predictor. Counts of concordant,
discordant and tied pairs are computed separately per stratum and then added.}

\item{data}{A data.frame used to interpret variables named in the formula. Only applicable
if object is a formula.}

\item{newdata}{Optional new data frame for evaluating models.}

\item{weights}{Optional vector of case weights, applicable only if object is a formula.}

\item{subset}{An expression indicating which subset of the rows of data should be used
in the fit. Only applicable if object is a formula.}

\item{na.action}{A missing-data filter function, applied to the model.frame after any
subset argument has been used. Default is options()$na.action. Only applicable if object
is a formula.}

\item{cluster}{Optional grouping vector for calculating robust variance.}

\item{ymin}{Optional lower bound for y values in the calculation.}

\item{ymax}{Optional upper bound for y values in the calculation.}

\item{timewt}{Weighting to be applied. The overall statistic is a weighted mean over
event times, with options like "n", "S", "S/G", "n/G2", "I".}

\item{influence}{Level of influence output to return, where 1=return the dfbeta vector,
2=return the full influence matrix, 3=return both.}

\item{ranks}{If TRUE, returns a data frame with ranks.}

\item{reverse}{If TRUE, assume larger x values predict smaller response values y.}

\item{timefix}{If TRUE, correct for possible rounding errors related to tied times.}

\item{keepstrata}{Either TRUE, FALSE, or an integer value. Computations are always done
within stratum, then added. If the total number of strata is greater than keepstrata, or
keepstrata=FALSE, those subtotals are not kept in the output.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'concordance' containing the estimated concordance value or values,
counts of concordant, discordant, and tied pairs, number of observations, estimated variance
of the concordance, and optionally, the data frame of ranks, dfbeta vector, and influence matrix.
}
\description{
This function computes the concordance statistic, which measures the agreement
between an observed response and a predictor. It is closely related to Kendall's
tau-a and tau-b, Goodman's gamma, and Somers' d, all of which can also be calculated
from the results of this function. This function handles different model types and
can be used with new data to evaluate but not refit the models.
