\title{Nested caseâ€“control (NCC) sampling weights}
\usage{
ncc_weights(time, status, strata = NULL, m = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Numeric vector of follow-up times.}

\item{status}{Numeric {0,1}, 1 = event, 0 = censored.}

\item{strata}{Optional factor/character for matching sets (matched NCC).}

\item{m}{Integer, number of controls per case (required).}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of weights.
}
\description{
Computes inverse-selection weights for NCC designs. If `strata` is
provided, matched NCC weights are computed.
