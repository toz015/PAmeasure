\usage{
handle_error(e)
}
\arguments{
\item{model1}{The fitted model for the target cause (either a `coxph` or `survreg` object).}

\item{model2}{The fitted model for competing causes (either a `coxph` or `survreg` object).}

\item{final_data}{A data frame containing observed event times (`obs.times`), event indicators (`obs.event`), and covariates.}

\item{event.type}{The event type of interest for which CIF is to be predicted.}

\item{tau}{The maximum time horizon for prediction.}

\item{num.grid}{Number of evaluation time points (i.e., grid points) for computing CIF. 
This parameter only affects calculations used in **pseudo RÂ² metrics**. For standard use cases, keep `num.grid = 1` (the default).}

\item{fg_model}{Optional Fine-Gray model object (`crr` from `cmprsk` package).}

\item{cr_model}{Optional competing risks random forest model object.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
  \item{tau_list}{Vector of time points used for evaluation.}
  \item{m_pred}{A matrix where the first column is time, and subsequent columns are predicted CIFs for each subject.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates cumulative incidence function (CIF) predictions for individual subjects 
across multiple types of competing risks models. It supports cause-specific Cox models, 
accelerated failure time (AFT) models (Weibull, Log-normal, Log-logistic), Fine-Gray models, 
and competing risks random survival forests.
